<h2>It is not trained with many images only 7000 (3500- gun image , 3500- other image)</h2>
<h4>if more then 0.5 then it could be a gun else not a gun</h4>
<p>trained in 120x120 images {resize it yourself one by one or use cv2.resize)<p>
<p>100 times epoch mean 100 times studied all images</p>
<p> at the time 98% accuracy - 80% test accuracy which is very low</p>
